# PiGlow for Raspberry Pi

"[PiGlow][1] is a spiral nebula of 18 coloured, individually-controllable LEDs for your Raspberry Pi. Use it for all sorts of things. And, of course, it fits inside a Pibow case!" -- from pimoroni's web site.

PiGlow is based round a SN3218 I2C LED controller ([datasheet][2]).
